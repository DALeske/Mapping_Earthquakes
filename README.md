# Module 13 Challenge: Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
This project is an example of obtaining GeoJSON data from an online source and creating an interactive online map using Leaflet and Mapbox. In this particular project, earthquake data is obtained from the US Geological Survey (USGS) website (www.usgs.gov) for earthquakes occurring worldwide over the past 7 days. The data is plotted on a map of the world with color-and-size-specific markers depending on the magnitude of the quake. Clicking on the marker displays the specific magnitude and location of the quake. Different selectable layers allow the user to see all earthquakes in the past 7 days or only the major earthquakes, defined as a magnitude of 4.5 or greater. In addition, tectonic plates are displayed on the map, allowing the user to see the association of quake location to the borders of the major tectonic plates.
